# Analysis Overview

In this repository I have included a few javascript files, an html file as well as a css file--all of which I've coded to help me display a webpage of earthquake data. The webpage displays a map with different layers that allows the user to switch between different earthquake data throughout the world. This map shows the relationship between the earth's tectonic plates and the earthquakes that occur in correspondence with them. The size of the dots and their colors all signify different earthquake magnitudes/ intensities.
